# dwqInsights
This package allows DWQ staff to explore water quality data used in IR assessments, delisting analyses, and TMDL development. It is designed to work with EPA's Water Quality Portal and DWQ's wqTools and irTools outputs to improve user knowledge of the state and data collected therein.
